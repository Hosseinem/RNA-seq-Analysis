# RNA-seq-Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to reproduce a simple RNA-seq pipeline on shRNA data from https://www.encodeproject.org.  
ENCODE ID: ENCSR554IWH Control Group: ENCSR573JSS. Each group has 8 files containing 4 replicates so 16 in total.  

## This analysis goes through three steps as follow:  

#### Quality Check (FASTQc)  

#### Mapping (Kallisto)  
- Containing a pipeline using an algorithm to automatically find the appropriate Reads and start the analysis; Can be used for any ENCODE analysis.

#### Quantification (Sleuth)
